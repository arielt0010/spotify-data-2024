This is a dashboard made in Power BI showing my music data through 2022 to 2025. The main focus is analysing my music taste for 2024.

Here are some insights of the dashboard for 2024:

* I listened more music on September, with 5039 minutes; and C.Tangana leads this portion, by 1485 minutes.

* I have played more songs on Wednesdays at 5 p.m. with 465 number of plays.

* I usuually tend to listen the same songs, without using the shuffle mode and always connected to the Internet.

* Lastly, I usually tends to listen music completely, rather than skipping songs.

And that's my analysis of my music taste from 2024. I hope that you liked.
